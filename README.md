# RailwaySimulationWithThreads
A simulation of trains on a railway

This project was made for a college task. The main objective is to simulate trains on a railway by using object-oriented programming in Java. 

To represent the trains, a class that extends the Thread class was created and the movement of the 
trains on the rails was made using the PathTransition class (in addition to adjacent ones).
